        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hi! My name is James Alison, a Biochemist with an interest in Software engineering and web design. I am also a PADI dive master and have a great passion for the Ocean, diving, surfing, fishing and many more. I have a passion for coding, creating innovative solutions, and learning new technologies. My experience ranges from working in a rural town in Northern KZN to working in major offices in Johannesburg.</p>
        <p>What motivates me the most is solving complex problems and delivering user-friendly applications. I take pride in writing clean, maintainable code and strongly believe in the agile methodology of iterative development.</p>
        <p>My ultimate career aspiration is to contribute to open source projects that make a significant impact on daily lives and to try and combine my biochemistry knowledge with my newly acquired coding knowledge.</p>
